# Contributing to Chronos project

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Chronos application! This document outlines the standards and requirements for the community contributions.

## Getting Started

*Note:* within the project, we follow the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) patterns for all commit messages. This allows for maintaining well defined release notes. All commits must follow this pattern. Examples (see [this](https://gist.github.com/qoomon/5dfcdf8eec66a051ecd85625518cfd13) for reference):

```txt
feat: commits that add, adjust or remove a new feature to the APIs or UI
fix: commits that fix an API routes or UI bugs
style: commits that address code style e.g. formatting
test: commits that add missing tests or correct existing ones
docs: commits that exclusively affect documentation
ops: commits that affect operational aspects like infrastructure, container images, scripts
chore: commits that represent modifying .gitignore, etc.
```
